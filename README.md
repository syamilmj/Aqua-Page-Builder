### Overview

Aqua Page Builder is a powerful WordPress plugin that allows you to create an unlimited number of template variations for use in your WordPress themes. 
It follows the same user interface used by the Menus & Widgets admin pages - making you feel right at home with the UI.

Similar to the Widgets &amps Menus, Aqua Page Builder features the drag and drop interaction to build its templates.

### User Guide

I've written a quite extensive guide for the users so they can get up and running
with the plugin in no time. The link to this guide is provided in the "Help" tab
for easier access, but you can also link to it manually in the theme description or
theme documentation: http://aquagraphite.com/api/documentation/aqua-page-builder (lie)
